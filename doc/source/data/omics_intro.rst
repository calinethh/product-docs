Omics Data Sources
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Omics data sources are primarily research knowledgebases and/or curated by individuals wiki-style. As such, while they serve a specific function, they will not be error-free, may be conflicting, and are often incomplete or cross functional lines. 

Our list and organization is not complete, but will be a work in progress. As these sources evolve we will track them here.
