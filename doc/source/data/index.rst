Data Sources
!!!!!!!!!!!!

This section covers the data sources we use in the platform and how they are organized.

Omics
@@@@@

Omics covers genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Omics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of pools of biological molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism or organisms. 

Omics data sources are primarily research knowledgebases and/or curated by individuals wiki-style. As such, while they serve a specific function, they will not be error-free, may be conflicting, and are often incomplete or cross functional lines. 

Our list and organization is not complete, but will be a work in progress. As these sources evolve we will track them here.

Clinical Data
@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Clinical data are any data from hospitals, labs, insurance companies, or other direct health care sources. These can include patient medical records, lab tests, and medical images.

Exogenous Data
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Exogenous data are related to the patient's lifestyle and environment. They include socioeconomics, environmental factors such as air quality, and lifestyle factors like diet and activity.

Remote Care Data
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Sequence annotations describe genomic features such as genes and exons, using terms from an established sequence ontology.
