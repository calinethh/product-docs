Biorepositories
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Biorepositories are exactly as they sound - repositories of biological data, especially genetic test data. See below for a common list of biorepositories around the globe.

Linked open data and biorepositories:

**1. IN USE**


**2. TARGETED**

* Danish National Biobank - 5.6M records

* eMERGE Network - 350K records. DNA repositories with linked electronic medical records. Data generated from network partners - eMERGE PGx (sequencing of target patients), IGNITE (research), electronic medical records (EMRs), ENCODE, CSER. ?epidemio and statistical analysis

* UK Biobank - 500K records. population-based repo of biological samples with linked medical, lifestyle, and family history data. Also have genetic and phenotypic data. Researchers oriented, ? epidemiological & statistical analysis not done.

* Estonian Genome Center - 52K records

* China Kadoorie Biobank - 500K records

* Kaiser Permanente Division of Research - 200K records

* MVP - 250K records

* Qatar Biobank - 300K records

* `Personal Genome Project (Harvard) <http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard/data/>`_


**3. UNDER INVESTIGATION**

* `Beacon Network <https://beacon-network.org/#/about>`_

* DailyMed - Structured Product Label (SPL) - pdts & ingredients, title of drug use

* PGx labeled FDA approved drugs - gene & functions but not all mention alleles

* CGN (shut down for now) - Clinical database of patients from 14 cancer centers

* NCI Specimen Resource Locator - biological samples from cancer patients. Biobank resource, researchers oriented

* BioLINCC - biological samples and clinical data from NHLBI studies. Biobank resource, researchers oriented, ? data format available - ie raw and need analysis

* Rare Disease-HUB - biological samples from patients with rare diseases. Biobank resources, researchers oriented, samples info & clinical data linked.

* PGP - genotype data with linked medical and personal information. Genome (WGS, exomes), trait, profiles, microbiome. Depends on willing participants. ? no. of participants so far, Likely that data analysis required

* iSAEC - clinical and genotyping data from studies of adverse drug events. Data dissemination web site has been setup to provide access to the iSAEC data by qualified researchers exclusively for the purpose of conducting biomedical research
