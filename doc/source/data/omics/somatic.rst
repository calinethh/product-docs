Somatic
!!!!!!!

**1. IN USE**


**2. TARGETED**

* COSMIC - Repository of somatic mutation, genotype and whole genome sequencing data from cancer studies (above)

* cBio Cancer Genomics Portal - Searchable Web-tool which integrates tumor and somatic mutation data from TCGA and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
Tumorscape - Repository of somatic CNV data from multiple cancer types

**3. UNDER INVESTIGATION**

* UCSC Xena - replaced Cancer Genomics Browser

* ICGC - DNA sequencing and somatic mutation data from 50 different tumor types (89 projects, drugs gene targets & mutations

* TCGA - DNA sequencing and somatic mutation data from 20 different tumor types

* Variant GPS - May have been deprecated and converted to DCEG. Repository of genotyping data and genetic variants identified from targeted next-generation sequencing in cancer studies. Links to DCEG - epidemiology of cancers

* Oncomine - Searchable Web-tool which integrates somatic CNV data from TCGA

* Genomics Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal - Seq, transcriptome, SNPs, CNVs, clinical. Includes data from TCGA (33 projects) & TARGET (6 projects) - cancer programs


**4. REJECTED**

* Cancer Genomics Browser - Web-tool which integrates somatic mutation data from TCGA and other cancer genomic studies. Browser no longer under development. Genome data originally from Genome Reference Consortium. Uses ENCODE data. New tool available - UCSC Xena
