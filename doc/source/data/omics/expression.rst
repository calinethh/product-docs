!!!!!!!!!!

**1. IN USE**



**2. TARGETED**

* UCSC Genome Browser - DNA sequences annotated with gene expression data from a wide range of sources



**3. UNDER INVESTIGATION**

* ICGC - Copy number, rearrangement, expression, mutation data. Cancer projects, data repo. Drug infor from DrugBank & ChEMBL (part of EMBL-EBI)

* GEO - Gene expression data from >2500 studies. Currently 4348 datasets, also a repo for RNAseq datasets. ? analysed or raw data or both - to double check

* European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) - WGS repo (raw, mapped & annotated)

* Oncomine - Gene expression data from GEO, TCGA and other projects. Thermo Fisher platform, need to register to see what they can really do. Claims 700+ independent datasets but ?? exact resources.

* Cell Miner - Gene expression and GI50 drug concentration data from NCI-60 cell lines. Datasets are raw or normalised. Facilitates systems biology research. miRBase, dbSNPs, GEO

* SBM DB - Hu mRNA (Affy U133A), HUVEC mRNA & protein (IHC) expression from healthy and tumoral tissues, normal and cancer cell lines. Provide base for new drug development

* GENT - Microarray-derived mRNA expression data from >34000 tissue samples

* Cancer Genome Anatomy Project - Gene expression from normal, precancer and cancer cells. CGAP/ MGC, ORESTES, EST libraries. Downloadable data in tab-delimited ASCII

* mirBase - miRNAs database, nomenclature.(a bit like dbSNP but only for miRNAs). need to find out where miRNAs microarrays vs conditions data are. can be found in ENCODE



**4. REJECTED**

* ArrayExpress - Microarray-derived mRNA expression data from >25000 studies (EMBL-EBI). Currently 69786 studies of raw datasets for research community. Not helpful as raw data are unmapped, without statistical significance to indicate relevance and require analysis
