Biorepositories are exactly as they sound - repositories of biological data, especially genetic test data. See below for a common list of biorepositories around the globe.

eQTL
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Linked open data and biorepositories:
* Bio2RDF: PharmGKB, OMIM, DrugBank, NCBI Gene, PubMed & many more 
multiple sources but use but downloaded datasets with the most recent dated as Sept 2014. Some datasets mentioned are research-oriented (eg Affy microarray probesets but not datasets). 
Outdated, a method for linking and creating compatible data from multiple sources.
Code method
* DailyMed - Structured Product Label (SPL) - pdts & ingredients, title of drug use
* PGx labeled FDA approved drugs - gene & functions but not all mention alleles
* CGN (shut down for now) - Clinical database of patients from 14 cancer centers
* NCI Specimen Resource Locator - biological samples from cancer patients
Biobank resource, researchers oriented
* BioLINCC - biological samples and clinical data from NHLBI studies 
Biobank resource, researchers oriented, ? data format available - ie raw and need analysis
* Rare Disease-HUB - biological samples from patients with rare diseases
Biobank resources, researchers oriented, samples info & clinical data linked.
* PGP - genotype data with linked medical and personal information
Genome (WGS, exomes), trait, profiles, microbiome
Depends on willing participants
? no. of participants so far,
Likely that data analysis required
* iSAEC - clinical and genotyping data from studies of adverse drug events
data dissemination web site has been setup to provide access to the iSAEC data by qualified researchers exclusively for the purpose of conducting biomedical research
* eMERGE Network - DNA repositories with linked electronic medical records
Data generated from network partners - eMERGE PGx (sequencing of target patients), IGNITE (research), electronic medical records (EMRs), ENCODE, CSER
?epidemio and statistical analysis
* UK Biobank - population-based repo of biological samples with linked medical, lifestyle, and family history data
Also have genetic and phenotypic data
Researchers oriented, ? epidemiological & statistical analysis not done.
