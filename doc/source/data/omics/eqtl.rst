eQTL - may not be useful
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**1. IN USE**



**2. TARGETED**




**3. UNDER INVESTIGATION**

* SCAN - SNP and CNV eQTLs identified in LCL. Classify SNPs & CNVs to functional types (eg eQTL, methyl-SNPs) and physical location (annotated to a gene if in LD). GTEx, ENDGAMe, PAAR

* GTEx - eQTL data from different tissues. ? normal tissues for reference. Tissue and data biobank (>30,000 samples. Analysis completion ~June/July 2017. Information released through dbGaP


**4. REJECTED**

* Eqtl - Genome browser with eQTL annotations. ? dead project, site last updated in June 2012
