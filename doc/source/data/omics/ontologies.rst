**1. IN USE**



**2. TARGETED**

* SNOMED CT - clinical ontologies

* GA4GH - genomic data. Not using the API but ours will have similar concepts. 

**3. UNDER INVESTIGATION**

* Bio2RDF: PharmGKB, OMIM, DrugBank, NCBI Gene, PubMed & many more. Multiple sources but use but downloaded datasets with the most recent dated as Sept 2014. Some datasets mentioned are research-oriented (eg Affy microarray probesets but not datasets). Outdated, a method for linking and creating compatible data from multiple sources. Code method

* HGNC - HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee, gene nomenclature

* Variation Ontology (VariO)

* LUMC Mutalyzer - variant nomenclature

* Mutation Impact Ontology (MIO)

* Sequence Ontology (SO)

* Semantic science Integrated Ontology (SIO)

* Clinical Decision Support (CDS) ontology
