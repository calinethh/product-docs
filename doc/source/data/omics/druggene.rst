**1. IN USE**


**2. TARGETED**

* DrugBank - DrugBank (drugs, formulations, targets, interactions)

* FDA Pharmacogenomics

* PharmGKB - industry standard for PGx

* CPIC - Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium guidelines. CPIC guidelines are designed to help clinicians understand HOW available genetic test results should be used to optimize drug therapy, rather than WHETHER tests should be ordered. 

**3. UNDER INVESTIGATION**

* CTD - Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (genes, chemicals, diseases, phenotypes). Integrated with: BioGRID (3.4.144 release), ChemIDplus® (as of 27 January 2017), DrugBank (as of 27 January 2017), GO (as of 27 January 2017), KEGG (as of 27 January 2017), MeSH® (2016 MeSH release), NCBI Gene (as of 27 January 2017), NCBI Taxonomy (as of 27 January 2017), PubMed® (as of 27 January 2017), Reactome (as of 27 January 2017)

* FINDBase - allele frequencies of PGx markers in different populations

* PHARMACO-GENDIA. offer genetic testing services, uses PharmGKB, Karolinska’s CytP450 db

* NCBI GTR - voluntary genetic testing information. resources : ClinVar, MedGen, NCBI’s mol med db & tools, OMIM, GeneReviews, Orphanet, NHGRI, Genetics Home Reference, Office of Rare Diseases Res, Genetic Alliance (mostly NIH resources)
