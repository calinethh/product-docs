Variants
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# IN USE

* Galaxy


# TARGETED

* dbSNP - Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database

* NCBI Gene - Integrative resource for genes, variants and phenotypes
Annotated genes, variants, phenotypes, linked to specific external resources
Also linked to NCBI Genome

* UCSC genome browser - annotated genomic reference sequences
Similar to NCBI resources but usually slower with update information as new research data are submitted to repositories appear in NCBI first.
Leave out for now, or use as secondary verification source

* Ensembl - annotated genomic reference sequences
Similar to NCBI resources, slower with updated data, and uses own IDs but longer string of numbers.
Tendency to remove untranslated region from mRNA sequences (ie only Start to Stop codon)
Also the basis for other EMBL-EBI resources

* NCBI Genome - Integrative resource for genes, variants and phenotypes
Chromosomal assemblies, sequences, maps and annotations
Less useful than NCBI Gene at this point


# UNDER INVESTIGATION

* AceView

* Genome Reference Consortium
Curators for genome assemblies, patches, fixes and updates.
Genome data sources (for mapping ie if patientsâ€™ genomic data require analysis)

* HVP - Human Variome Project
Work to consolidate existing gene/disease specific databases
Refers back to Locus Specific Mutation Databases at Leiden (repeated below)

* LOVD Leiden Open Variation Database
Nomenclature and linking variants under different names in research
COSMIC - Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer
Resources include Cell Lines Project (104), COSMIC, Cancer Gene Census, Drug Sensitivity, Mutational Signatures, GRCh37 Cancer Archive.

* NIEHS SNPs - SNP discovery resource focused on environmental exposures, inter-individual sequence variation, disease risk
Resequencing, data available for download
New variations deposited back to dbSNPs cos have rs IDs

* UCSC Genome assembly for positional mapping

* Seattle SNPs - SNP discovery resource for inflammatory responses
Re-sequencing methodology advice & guidance to researchers, 
dbSNP, RefSeq/NCBI genome assembly


# REJECTED

* Hapmap - Note: deprecated, ignore. Subsumed by 1,000 genomes project - snp genotypes from 11 different populations
