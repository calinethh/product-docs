Gene-Phenotype
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**1. IN USE**



**2. TARGETED**

* GWAS Central - genetic wide association studies for wide range of conditions (>1844 studies). dbSNPs, DBGV

* OMIM - Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man

* NCBI ClinVar - clinically relevant variants

* PhenGenI - Phenotype-Genotype Integrator (PheGenI), merges NHGRI genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog data with Gene, dbGaP, OMIM, GTEx and dbSNP

* ClinGen - database of clinical genomics

**3. UNDER INVESTIGATION**

* dbGaP- Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. controlled access mechanisms

* PhenCode - human genotype and phenotype, link locus specific dbs, UniProt with USCS Genome browser

* Model Organisms (which hyperlink?) - mouse, rat, worm, fly, yeast, slime mold

* Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium - identifies genome sequence variants including major causes of morbidity and mortality through large-scale GWAS. WT funded projects, mostly UK. Application for data access, ie controlled access through Eur Genotype Archive (EBI). Researchers oriented

* EMBL-EBI GWAS

* HuGE Navigator - web tools enabling mining of literature and genetic association studies. Human Genome Epidemiology encyclopedia. CDC dbs, MeSH, NCBI Gene, HUGO, Pubmed

* ENCODE Project - genome browser, non-coding functional elements, new site for project at https://www.encodeproject.org/. Data viewable in GENCODE on BioDalliance Browser specifically for human and mouse genome

* SNP Function Portal - annotation of snps at the genome, transcript, protein, pathway, disease, and population levels. Research oriented for own data. Use infor from GB, UniGene LocusLink

* pfSNP - SNP function and results from GWAS

* Pupasuite - bioinformatic analyses of SNP functions - toolkits; research oriented

* FuncPred - bioinformatic analyses of SNP functions. dbSNP, miRanda

* F-SNP - bioinformatic analyses of SNP functions. dbSNP, Ensembl, SIFT, PolyPhen,


**4. REJECTED**

* NHGRI catalog - GWAS results, catalog moved to EMBL-EBI GWAS

* SIFT - effects of non-synonymous SNPs; predictions. dbSNP, Ensembl gene. Not useful at the moment

* PolyPhen - effects of non-synonymous SNPs; prediction. Not useful at the moment

* PhenX - GWAS & epi tool kit, research oriented. ? downloaded sources, ignore for now.
