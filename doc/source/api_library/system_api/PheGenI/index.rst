PheGenI System API
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The Phenotype-Genotype Integrator (PheGenI), merges NHGRI genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog data with several databases housed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), including Gene, dbGaP, OMIM, GTEx and dbSNP.  This phenotype-oriented resource, intended for clinicians and epidemiologists interested in following up results from GWAS, can facilitate prioritization of variants to follow up, study design considerations, and generation of biological hypotheses.  Users can search based on chromosomal location, gene, SNP, or phenotype and view and download results including annotated tables of SNPs, genes and association results, a dynamic genomic sequence viewer, and gene expression data. PheGenI is still under active development.  Currently, the phenotype search terms are based on MeSH and will be enhanced with additional options in the future.
