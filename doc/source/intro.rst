General Overview
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The product contains an organized collection of research and medical databases, hosted in a secure, HIPAA-compliant location. The key data are integrated and exposed through services via an API-led architecture including system, process, and experience APIs. As such, we are not constructing a data lake; rather a highly-available distributed network of data sources and applications, including analysis "tracks" layered on for things like machine learning predictions of disease risk or drug efficacy.
